# Proc3Dural
A procedural physics-heavy 3D application that I (will hopefully) work on for my free time
I'm working on this 3D thing in hopes that somebody ends up liking it and/or using it
Frankly, free stuff is free stuff and this thing is in tandem with the learning I plan to do on C/C++ and Physics

Also, please forgive me for the bad pun in the name of the software :)
